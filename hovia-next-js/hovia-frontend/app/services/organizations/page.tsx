            We manage projects in the education industry. As Educational
            Strategist we work alongside educational leaders, teachers, and
            students in advisory roles to execute projects, implement change, to
            create optimal learning environments. Whether itâ€™s coordinating a
            new curriculum rollout, organizing a student field trip, or starting
            up an education organization, we facilitate the whole process of
            planning, organizing, directing, controlling, evaluating, and
            reviewing of activities of the education project, by utilizing human
            and material resources effectively and efficiently to accomplish
            functions of teaching, learning and development.
